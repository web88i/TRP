## 🔧 Refactoring Guidelines

1. **Maintain Functionality**: All original features must work identically
1. **Maintain Functionality**: All original features must work identically
2. **Improve Structure**: Better organization and separation of concerns
3. **Add Type Safety**: Gradual TypeScript adoption
4. **Clean Dependencies**: Remove unused code and optimize imports
5. **Document Changes**: Clear documentation for all modifications

## 📝 Notes

### Recent Progress (Current Session)
- ✅ Implemented SceneManager for centralized scene coordination
- ✅ Created BaseScene abstract class for consistent scene structure
- ✅ Built MainScene with complete 3D model setup and interactions
- ✅ Implemented SpecsScene with product showcase features
- ✅ Created MaterialSystem for centralized material management
- ✅ Developed AnimationSystem for timeline and animation control
- ✅ Built comprehensive UI component library:
  - Button component with ripple effects and accessibility
  - Modal component with focus management and animations
  - Cursor module with smooth following and interactive states
- ✅ Enhanced WebGL integration with theme-aware materials
- ✅ Built NavigationModule with accessibility and animations
- ✅ Developed AudioToggleModule with wave visualization
- ✅ Created LoaderModule with progress tracking
- ✅ Enhanced WebGL integration with scene management
- ✅ Improved module system with dynamic loading

- Original project remains untouched during migration
- Each file is refactored individually and tested
- New architecture uses modern ES modules and clean imports
- Theme system is enhanced with better organization
- WebGL code is restructured for better maintainability
