# TRANSLINK - Refactored Architecture

This is the refactored version of the Translink Earbuds web experience, featuring a clean, modular architecture designed for maintainability and scalability.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Structure
```

├── core/           # Core application logic and initialization
├── modules/        # Feature modules (UI, navigation, loader, audio)
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── utils/          # Utility functions and helpers
├── webgl/          # WebGL/Three.js related code
├── audio/          # Audio system and effects
├── theme/          # Theme system and customization
├── assets/         # Static assets and resources
└── styles/         # CSS and styling
```

## 🔄 Migration Status

This project is currently being migrated from the original codebase. Files are being refactored incrementally to ensure:

- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Improved modularity
- ✅ Better type safety
- ✅ Enhanced maintainability
- ✅ Consistent code organization

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 📁 Module Organization

### Core (`src/core/`)
- Application initialization
- Event system
- State management
- Configuration

### Modules (`src/modules/`)
- **UI**: User interface components and interactions
- **Navigation**: Menu, routing, and page transitions
- **Loader**: Loading screens and progress indicators
- **Audio**: Audio controls and sound effects

### WebGL (`src/webgl/`)
- **Scenes**: 3D scene management
- **Materials**: Shader materials and textures
- **Geometry**: 3D geometry and effects
- **Shaders**: Custom GLSL shaders
- **Effects**: Post-processing and visual effects

### Components (`src/components/`)
- Reusable UI components
- Form elements
- Modal dialogs
- Interactive elements

## 🎯 Migration Progress

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each file should have one clear purpose
2. **Modular Design**: Components should be self-contained and reusable
3. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for better development experience
4. **Clean Imports**: Use path aliases for cleaner import statements
5. **Documentation**: Document complex logic and public APIs
